# Edge-Central Shortest Paths (ECSP)

This repository contains exploratory experiments on the Edge-Central Shortest Path (ECSP)
problem, which selects, among all shortest s–t paths, the one that maximizes cumulative
edge centrality.

The code (to be added) will include:
- edge centrality computation (betweenness, closeness, gravity-style, ECHO)
- shortest-path DAG construction
- dynamic programming solver for ECSP
- experiments over synthetic and real networks
- ECSP-based robustness evaluation

This is a work in progress.
